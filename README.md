Project Approva:

An internal organisation tool where employees submit expenses and managers approve or reject them.

Types of users: admin, employee, manager

Employee: employee user can only submit expenses, edit (show edited) and put comments.
Manager: manager has all user permissions plus it can approve expenses.
Admin: admin has all manager permissions plus it can make teams and assign managers.

Employee and Manager users will make accounts (exactly the same way), accounts can be only made using organisation email which ends with @projectapprova.com.

Managers can have their managers too, organisational hierarchy.
The user which has posted the expense cannot approve it on their own, until they’re admin (consider admin a CEO).

An expense has a lifecycle. draft -> submitted -> approved or rejected.

An expense cannot be deleted, it can only be rejected.
